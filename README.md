# today

`today` is a Python 3 script that makes it easier to keep a daily journal. It
creates a file for each day and opens it in your favorite editor. The initial
motivation was to create an easy to use daily work journal.



## Usage

`today` creates a journal file `YYYYMMDD.md` with the timestamp of the current
day. The file is opened with `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR` if the former is not
defined. The journal files are stored in the first directory that exists among

``` bash
$TODAYDIR
$XDG_DATA_HOME/today
$HOME/.local/share/today
```

The `today` repository contains symbolic links to `today` under various names
which act as shortcuts for common tasks.

``` bash
today     # Edit today's journal
yesterday # Edit yesterday's journal
tomorrow  # Edit tomorrow's journal
lastday   # Edit the most recent journal excluding today's journal
week      # Pretty print this week's journals
lastweek  # Pretty print last week's journals
nextweek  # Pretty print next week's journals
```

Run `man today` for more detailed information.



## Installation

Create the symbolic links and install the script along with the manpage:

``` bash
make
sudo make install
```
