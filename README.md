# today

`today` is a POSIX shell script that makes it easier to keep a daily journal.
The motivation for it was creating an easy to use daily work journal.

`today` stores each daily journal as a file whose basename is the corresponding
date. It allows opening the file with the corresponding date in your favorite
editor. It also creates a to-do file for notes that persist between days. It's
configurable through environment variables. This makes it easier to keep
multiple journals on the same computer.


## Installation

The dependencies are a POSIX system and `scdoc` to build the manpage. To build
the manpage run `make`. To install the script and its manpage run `make
install`. You might need to run it as root.


## Usage

``` sh
# Open today's journal file.
today
# Open the journal file for the 5th of the current month.
today 05
# Open the journal file for the 14th of October of the current year.
today 10-14
# Search all journal files using the regular expression "^Today".
today grep ^Today
# Show the contents of all journal files in a pager.
today log
```
