# DESCRIPTION

*today* is a Python 3 script that makes it easier to keep a daily journal. It
creates a file for each day and opens it in your favorite editor. The initial
motivation was to create an easy to use daily work journal.

*today*/*yesterday*/*tomorrow* opens file YYYYMMDD.md with
today's/yesterday's/tomorrow's date using _VISUAL_.

*lastday* opens the most recent journal file excluding today's file using
_VISUAL_.

*nextday* opens the closest future journal file using _VISUAL_.

*week*/*lastweek*/*nextweek* renders all the journal files for this/the last/the
next week using _PAGER_.

If a date in the _YYYYMMDD_ format is provided, that date is used instead of the
one inferred from the program name.

If a _FILE_ is provided, that file is rendered instead of the files inferred
from the program name.

If a journal file is empty or contains only whitespace after being edited it
will be deleted.

The journal files are stored in the first directory among _$TODAYDIR_,
_$XDG_DATA_HOME/today_ and _$HOME/.local/share/today_ that exists.
