# NAME

today - keep a daily journal


# SYNOPSIS

*today* [[[_YYYY-_]_MM-_]_DD_]++
*today* *grep* _argument_ ...++
*today* *log* [*-v*]++
*today* *-h*


# DESCRIPTION

*today* [[[_YYYY-_]_MM-_]_DD_] opens the journal file for the specified date for
editing by running the command in the $*TODAY_CMD* environment variable. If year
and month are omitted they default to the current year and month. With no
arguments a file with the current date is opened for editing.

*today* *grep* _argument_ ... searches through all journal files by calling
*grep*(1) with the supplied _argument_\s.

*today* *log* prints the contents of all journal files in reverse chronological
order on standard output. The contents of each file are preceded by the date in
the YYYY-MM-DD format and two newlines and followed by three newlines. If
standard output is connected to a terminal it will be piped to the program
specified in the $*PAGER* environment variable.

A to-do file is used for notes that persist between days.

If a journal file is empty after being edited it's deleted.

Journal files are stored in the directory specified in the $*TODAY_DIR*
environment variable with a _YYYY-MM-DD_ basename and the contents of the
$*TODAY_SUFFIX* environment variable as a suffix. The to-do file is also stored
in $*TODAY_DIR* with a *todo* basename and a $*TODAY_SUFFIX* suffix.
