# NAME

today - keep a daily journal


# SYNOPSIS

*today* [[[_YYYY-_]_MM-_]_DD_] ...++
*today* *grep* _argument_ ...++
*today* *-h*


# DESCRIPTION

*today* [[[_YYYY-_]_MM-_]_DD_] ... opens the journal file for the specified date
for editing by running the command in the $*TODAY_CMD* environment variable. If
year and month are omitted they default to the current year and month. If
multiple dates are supplied all respective files are shown in $*PAGER* in
chronological order. With no arguments a file with the current date is opened
for editing.

*today* *grep* _argument_ ... searches through all journal files by calling
*grep*(1) with the supplied _argument_\s.

A to-do file is used for notes that persist between days.

If a journal file is empty after being edited it's deleted.

Journal files are stored in the directory specified in the $*TODAY_DIR*
environment variable with a _YYYY-MM-DD_ basename and the contents of the
$*TODAY_SUFFIX* environment variables as a suffix. The to-do file is also stored
in $*TODAY_DIR* with a *todo* basename and a $*TODAY_SUFFIX* suffix.
