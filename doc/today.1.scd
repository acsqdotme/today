# DESCRIPTION

*today* is a Python 3 script that makes it easier to keep a daily journal. It
creates a Markdown file for each day and opens it in your favorite editor. The
initial motivation was to create an easy to use daily work journal.

*today*/*yesterday*/*tomorrow* opens a Markdown file YYYYMMDD.md with
today's/yesterday's/tomorrow's date using _VISUAL_.

*lastday* opens the most recent journal file excluding today's file
using _VISUAL_.

*week*/*lastweek*/*nextweek* renders all the journal files for
this/the last/the next week using _PAGER_.

When _FILES_ are provided they are always rendered instead of edited.

The journal files are stored in the first directory among _$TODAYDIR_,
_$XDG_DATA_HOME/today_ and _$HOME/.local/share/today_ that exists.
