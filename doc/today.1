.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBtoday\fR is a Python 3 script that makes it easier to keep a daily journal.\& It
creates a file for each day and opens it in your favorite editor.\& The initial
motivation was to create an easy to use daily work journal.\&
.P
\fBtoday\fR/\fByesterday\fR/\fBtomorrow\fR opens file YYYYMMDD.\&md with
today's/yesterday's/tomorrow's date using \fIVISUAL\fR.\&
.P
\fBlastday\fR opens the most recent journal file excluding today's file using
\fIVISUAL\fR.\&
.P
\fBweek\fR/\fBlastweek\fR/\fBnextweek\fR renders all the journal files for this/the last/the
next week using \fIPAGER\fR.\&
.P
If a date in the \fIYYYYMMDD\fR format is provided, that date is used instead of the
one inferred from the program name.\&
.P
If a \fIFILE\fR is provided, that file is rendered instead of the files inferred
from the program name.\&
.P
If a journal file is empty or contains only whitespace after being edited it
will be deleted.\&
.P
The journal files are stored in the first directory among \fI$TODAYDIR\fR,
\fI$XDG_DATA_HOME/today\fR and \fI$HOME/.\&local/share/today\fR that exists.\&
