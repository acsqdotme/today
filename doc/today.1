.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBtoday\fR [[[\fIYYYY-\fR]\fIMM-\fR]\fIDD\fR] .\&.\&.\& opens the journal file for the specified date
for editing by running $\fBTODAY_CMD\fR.\& If multiple dates are supplied all
respective files are shown in $\fBPAGER\fR.\& With no arguments a file with today's
date is opened for editing.\& If year and month are omitted they default to the
current year and month.\&
.P
\fBtoday\fR \fBgrep\fR \fIargument\fR .\&.\&.\& searches through all journal files by calling
\fBgrep\fR(1) with the supplied \fIargument\fRs.\&
.P
A to-do file is used for notes that persist between days.\&
.P
If a journal file is empty after being edited it's deleted.\&
.P
Journal files are stored in $\fBTODAY_DIR\fR with a \fIYYYY-MM-DD\fR basename and a
$\fBTODAY_SUFFIX\fR suffix.\& The to-do file is also stored in $\fBTODAY_DIR\fR with a
\fBtodo\fR basename and a $\fBTODAY_SUFFIX\fR suffix.\&
