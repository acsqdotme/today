.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBtoday\fR [[[\fIYYYY-\fR]\fIMM-\fR]\fIDD\fR] .\&.\&.\& opens the journal file for the specified date
for editing by running the command in the $\fBTODAY_CMD\fR environment variable.\& If
year and month are omitted they default to the current year and month.\& If
multiple dates are supplied all respective files are shown in $\fBPAGER\fR in
chronological order.\& With no arguments a file with the current date is opened
for editing.\&
.P
\fBtoday\fR \fBgrep\fR \fIargument\fR .\&.\&.\& searches through all journal files by calling
\fBgrep\fR(1) with the supplied \fIargument\fRs.\&
.P
A to-do file is used for notes that persist between days.\&
.P
If a journal file is empty after being edited it's deleted.\&
.P
Journal files are stored in the directory specified in the $\fBTODAY_DIR\fR
environment variable with a \fIYYYY-MM-DD\fR basename and the contents of the
$\fBTODAY_SUFFIX\fR environment variables as a suffix.\& The to-do file is also stored
in $\fBTODAY_DIR\fR with a \fBtodo\fR basename and a $\fBTODAY_SUFFIX\fR suffix.\&
